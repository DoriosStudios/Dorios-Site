[![](/img/addons/ascendant/liquifier.png)](/img/addons/ascendant/liquifier.png)

Thermal crucible that melts solids into fluid, with a chance of residue.

## What it does
- Converts solid items into fluid in the internal tank.
- Can produce secondary residue.
- Pushes fluid to adjacent connections when available.
- Supports fluid network distribution through fluid cables.

## How to use
1. Insert the solid item in the input.
2. Ensure there is space in the fluid tank.
3. Extract the fluid via pipes/capsules and take residue from the dedicated slot (if any).

## Inputs and outputs
- **Input**: solid items supported by recipes.
- **Outputs**: fluid in the internal tank and optional residue.

## Machine Capabilities
- **Energy Capacity**: 8,192,000 DE (8.19 MDE)
- **Energy Consumption**: Varies per recipe (3,600 - 12,800 DE per craft)
- **Processing Rate**: 3,600 DE/tick
- **Fluid Tank Capacity**: 128,000 mB (128 buckets)
- **Upgrade Slots**: 2 slots (supports speed and energy upgrades)

## Fluids
- The tank receives the fluid produced by the recipe.
- The capsule slot lets you transfer fluid between capsules and the tank.
- Fluid is automatically pushed to adjacent blocks and through fluid networks.
- Supports two fluid types: **Liquified Aetherium** and **Dark Matter**.
