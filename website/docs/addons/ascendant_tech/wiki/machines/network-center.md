# Network Center

[![](/img/addons/ascendant/network_center.png)](/img/addons/ascendant/network_center.png)

Control panel that scans the connected energy network and shows a full system summary.

> [!NOTE]
> Not the final UI design; WILL change in future versions.

## What it does
- Scans cables and energy-tagged blocks in the network.
- Counts machines, generators, batteries, cables, and nodes.
- Shows stored energy, capacity, balance, and overall status.
- Provides real-time monitoring of network health and performance.

## How to use
1. Connect the block to the energy network.
2. Keep enough energy for continuous scanning.
3. Read the panels shown in the block UI.

## Machine Capabilities
- **Energy Capacity**: 800,000 DE (0.8 MDE)
- **Energy Consumption**: 400 DE per scan cycle
- **Processing Rate**: 8,000 DE/tick
- **Scan Interval**: Approximately every ~2 seconds
- **Network Limit**: 4096 nodes (with truncation warning beyond this limit)
- **Upgrade Slots**: None

## What appears on the panels
- **Consumption** (machines) and **generation** (generators).
- **Stored energy**, **capacity**, and **free space**.
- **Net flow** per tick and **status** (Stable/Charging/Draining/Deficit/Buffer Full).
- **Truncation warning** when the network exceeds the safety limit (4096 nodes).

## Network Monitoring
The Network Center provides comprehensive monitoring of:
- **Machines**: Active energy consumers in the network
- **Generators**: Active energy producers in the network
- **Batteries**: Energy storage devices
- **Cables**: Energy transmission infrastructure
- **Total Nodes**: Complete count of network-connected blocks

## Performance Notes
- Constant energy consumption required to maintain monitoring.
- Scan cycles run automatically approximately every 2 seconds.
- Large networks (approaching 4096 nodes) may show performance warnings.
