# UtilityCraft: Ascendant Technology

Welcome to **Ascendant Technology**, the official end-game expansion for **UtilityCraft**.

If UtilityCraft is your journey from *basic survival* to *full automation*, Ascendant Technology is what comes next: smarter logistics, more deliberate automation, and complex machines that reward planning instead of giant, messy farms.

Ascendant Technology blends **industrial progression** with **advanced tech** and a *minimal touch of fantasy*, while staying grounded in UtilityCraft’s existing balance philosophy: powerful, but earned.

> **Compatibility:** Ascendant Technology is a DLC-style expansion and requires UtilityCraft installed.

## What Does Ascendant Technology Add?

Ascendant Technology extends UtilityCraft with late-game systems that interlock with its existing energy and automation loops.

You’ll find:

- **Multi-factorial Machines** – Machines that use multiple inputs, catalysts, and even fluids, often producing residues and byproducts.
- **Cryogenic System (Cryofluid)** – A new coolant fluid used for stabilizing and cooling items and enabling advanced processing.
- **New Materials** – Late-game resources such as **Titanium** and **Aetherium**-chain items used in recipes and progression.
- **Automation & Diagnostics** – Better visibility into your factory with tools like the **Network Center**.
- **Quality-of-Life UI** – Dark-themed, modular UI components and per-machine interface improvements.
- **Planned: Gases** – A fourth “element” alongside items, energy, and fluids (coming in future updates).

The goal is simple: **automate more, with less world clutter**, and give players who mastered UtilityCraft a new layer of depth.

## Core Features

Ascendant Technology focuses on end-game gameplay loops and infrastructure:

- **Same Energy Standard (DE)**  
  No new power system to learn. Ascendant Technology machines run on **Dorios Energy (DE)** from UtilityCraft.

- **Complex Machines, Real Payoff**  
  Machines like the **Catalyst Weaver** and **Cryo Chamber** introduce high-tier processing with multiple “layers” (catalysts, fluids, residues, temperature states).

- **Factory Without Mega-Farms**  
  Build automation chains that reduce the need for giant, laggy farms—especially for rarer or more annoying resources.

- **End & Nether Motivation**  
  Progression aims to give you more reasons to interact with The End and the Nether as part of your late-game upgrade path.

- **Late-Game Logistics**  
  Heavy-duty storage blocks and diagnostics help keep complex setups understandable and maintainable.

- **Cryofluid & Cooling Tech**  
  Cooling isn’t just cosmetic: it unlocks advanced processing and item state control.

## Progression Path

Ascendant Technology is designed for players already established in UtilityCraft. A typical progression looks like this:

1. **Entry Point** – Arrive with an established DE setup and late-game UtilityCraft infrastructure.
2. **Catalyst Weaver Era** – Build the **Catalyst Weaver** and start producing early Ascendant materials (the gateway into the DLC).
3. **Aetherium Access** – Unlock **Aetherium** chain recipes (used to push into higher-tier infrastructure and upgrades).
4. **Titanium & Cryogenics** – Secure **Titanium** and build the **Cryo Chamber** to create **Cryofluid**, stabilize volatile items, and unlock cooling-based recipes.
5. **Factory Visibility** – Add tools like the **Network Center** (and other late-game logistics) to keep your systems readable and scalable.
6. **High-End Machines** – Expand into machines like the **Liquifier** and **Singularity Fabricator**, where planning and resource flow matter as much as raw power.
7. **Future Updates** – Gases and deeper multi-system automation loops.

Each step is meant to feel like a real upgrade to your factory—without replacing the fun of survival.
